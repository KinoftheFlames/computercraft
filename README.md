computercraft
=============

A collection of programs, hacks, and viruses I wrote in Lua while I was playing the Computercraft mod for Minecraft. Computercraft is a mod for Minecraft that adds computers and bots (turtles) that can run programs, and interact with peripherals such as a floppy drive and a wireless network.
